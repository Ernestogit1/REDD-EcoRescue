## Calculation Methodology

### Emission Factors
The calculator uses scientifically-based emission factors:

- **Transportation**:
  - Car: 0.404 kg CO‚ÇÇ per mile
  - Public Transit: 0.14 kg CO‚ÇÇ per mile
  - Flights: 0.255 kg CO‚ÇÇ per hour

- **Energy**:
  - Electricity: 0.92 kg CO‚ÇÇ per kWh
  - Natural Gas: 0.054 kg CO‚ÇÇ per therm
  - Heating Oil: 22.61 kg CO‚ÇÇ per gallon

- **Waste**:
  - Landfill: 0.5 kg CO‚ÇÇ per pound
  - Recycling Reduction: 0.25 kg CO‚ÇÇ per pound

### Lifestyle Multipliers
- **Meat Consumption**: Low (0.7x), Moderate (1.0x), High (1.4x)
- **Local Food**: Low (1.2x), Moderate (1.0x), High (0.8x)
- **Clothing**: Low (0.8x), Moderate (1.0x), High (1.3x)

## Impact Categories
